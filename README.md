# Programming-Challenges
For those that want more of a challenge, and already feel comfortable with programming.

#CHALLENGES PART1
1. Make a number-base convertor, i.e. from hexadecimal to decimal, and vice-versa
2. The String class has over 50 methods built into it. Make a code snippet
   exploring 5 of these methods, which we have NOT used in PART1 already.
3. Ever wondered if you could convert a byte to an int, or vice-versa? Explore
   type-casting, and write comments in your code snippet explaining how it works.
4. Why can't we compare String variables with our boolean operators? Write a
   a program that shows two String variables with the same value as not equal, and explain in a comment why this is.
5. Recursion is a beautiful thing, but sometimes if it ain't broke
   we can still tweak it. Make a factorial function WITHOUT using recursion.
