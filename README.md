# Programming-Challenges
For those that want more of a challenge, and already feel comfortable with programming.

# CHALLENGES PART1
1. There's a reason that even though short uses half the memory of an int, it still
   often is less effecient. Look up type-promotion, and see what happens to a byte
   or a short when you try and use them for math. Write a code snippet showing how
   type-promotion works. For bonus points, see how this works with long values that don't
   specify an "L", and write a code snippet exemplifying it as well.
2. Make a number-base convertor, i.e. from hexadecimal to decimal, and vice-versa
3. The String class has over 50 methods built into it. Make a code snippet
   exploring 5 of these methods, which we have NOT used in PART1 already.
4. Ever wondered if you could convert a byte to an int, or vice-versa? Explore
   type-casting, and write comments in your code snippet explaining how it works.
5. Why can't we compare String variables with our boolean operators? Write a
   a program that shows two String variables with the same value as not equal, and explain in a comment why this is.
6. Recursion is a beautiful thing, but sometimes if it ain't broke
   we can still tweak it. Make a factorial function WITHOUT using recursion.
6. Write two lambda expressions, one that converts the input in degrees to radians,
   and one that converts the input in radians to degrees. *Hint*, check out [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java8/java8_lambda_expressions.htm)
